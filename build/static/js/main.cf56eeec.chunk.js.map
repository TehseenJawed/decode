Not only does it allow the freedom for employees to work remotely and avoid the painstaking commute but it saves you on office space and grants you access to an entire world of talent. But no amount of expertise assembled together from the four corners of the earth will be effective without proper project management software to back up their efforts. <br />\r\n                 These are things you need to consider when deciding what management software to choose. Are you looking for help with reporting? Do you prefer to customize all models or would you be more comfortable with templates? Similarly, PM goals can be broken down into more technical needs by focusing on software that implements tools for communication, automatization and time tracking apps. Also, be on the lookout for software with excellent security data protection.<br />\r\n                 To make the decision on what will fit your company’s needs the most, consider using a decision mental model to essentially cut through the noise and make a smart decision. Consider it an exercise in project management methodology. While doing so, consider these three questions: Are the communication needs being met? Is the software providing the tools needed for your projects? And finally, is it making the job easier to accomplish?`,\r\n                heading2:'The Sharpest Tools in the Shed',\r\n                heading2desc1:`No project management plan would be achievable without the correct tools to go with the correct team members. The software you choose needs to be just as well selected as any team hire. Keep in mind your list of requirements that are needed to help your PM team succeed with each project. Such as time tracking for each remote employee. Often apps such as Youtrack or WhenIWork can come into play for that but is there a software package that already includes it? If you rely heavily on agile reporting consider JIRA as your software. Along with winning FinancesOnline’s award of “Great User Experience 2017” it boasts knowledge management, well-documented development flow, real-time collaboration, internal and external project management and of course agile reporting.<br /><br />\r\n                JIRA comes in three different formats:`,\r\n                serve:['JIRA Core: typical project management software, generic in every way.', 'JIRA Software: base software along with agile project management features', 'JIRA Service Desk: IT or Business Service Desk.'],\r\n                kjk:`Again, it’s important to narrow down what type of functions you’d like your software package to come with. JIRA starts out with 10 users for $10/month or 11–100 for $7/month. <br />\r\n                If the Kanban method appeals to your team, you might want to check out Monday.com. Functioning as a single board, members can see who’s working on what and the 100% transparency might be helpful if team leaders need task updates but struggle to get it from distance members. Another great feature is it allows clients themselves to be invited as guest viewers, allowing them to track project progress. Monday.com starts off at $29/month for 5 users at 5GB however it maxes at 10 users for $59/month. <br />\r\n                Another software to consider is Wrike. Geared especially for remote project management teams, Wrike was one of the first to make use of the Gantt chart. Working well with quite a few popular third-party apps such as Google Drive, Dropbox, MS Project, Excel, Box, Salesforce, Zapier, and Github to name a few, this software specializes in burndown charts or workload view, resource assignment, set dates, shave files and individual and group tagging with @mention. Wrike also offers what’s called a “Duplication Feature” which saves the skeleton of previous plans and if a new one is similar, it will launch a customizable old plan to save on formatting. <br />\r\n                The free plan allows up to 5 users and then expand to the Professional package of $49/month and up to 15 users and then on to Enterprise at $99/month to up to 5,000 users and 5GB. Ideal for companies with large PM teams. <br /><br />`,\r\n                heading3:'Making the Plan Easy',\r\n                heading3desc:[],\r\n                blogHref:'https://blog.zipboard.co/how-to-choose-the-best-project-management-software-for-your-team-8939d0b071c',\r\n                blogImg:'https://miro.medium.com/max/2363/1*Zl77kSHXBSGyl4QTZ1oeXg.jpeg',\r\n                blogdesc:[\r\n                    'The whole point of acquiring PM software is to move away from Excel spreadsheets and into the new age of digital project planning.
